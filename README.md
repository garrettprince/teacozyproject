## General Information
- Static and very unpretty website showing off basics of flexbox
- Use of flex, justify, align and other basic CSS flex related properties


## Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS 3


## Features
- Basic screen resizing (no media queries, just flex)


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ 


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- I realized about halfway through the project that I was using a more complex way of aligning text in a box (the flexbox method) when I could have been using  `text-align: center`  for the majority of text based info on the practice site

- Was able to keep CSS file fairly clean and readable compared to previous practices. Still can reduce number of div classes and IDs throughout. Feels a bit bloated overall

- Need more practice on `flex-wrap` properties. In the main photo section, I ran into an issue with the `space-between` property that is used with `justify-content` when `flex-direction` is `column`. I ended up creating two div containers, each with their own flex properties, to fit the assigment. As far as looks go, it's pretty spot on. Functionality when resizing screens is less to be desired though.

To do:
- Make it a GitHub Page to view site in browser
